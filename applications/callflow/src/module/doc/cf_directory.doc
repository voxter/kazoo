# The basic flow of a directory call:
# 1) Prompt: Please enter the first few letters of the person's
#  a) First entry in sort order (first or last name)
# 2) Receive MIN_DTMF dtmf tones
#  a) If timeout occurs:
#   1) Prompt: You need to specify a minimum of
#    a) MIN_DTMF
#    b) Prompt: letters of the person's name
#   2) go back into main #2
# 3) After receiving MIN_DTMF, filter table
# 4) Go into a next_dtmf wait loop
#  a) if timeout, prompt with # of matches, option to hear matches or continue pressing keys
#  b) if continue, go into next_dtmf wait loop
#  c) else go to play_matches
# 5) play_matches: play hd(matches), options to hear more or connect or continue pressing keys
#
# If the flag "asr_enabled" is set, send the asr AMQP request, wait for the ASR response, and use
# that for finding matches. Its more an all-or-nothing situation.
#
# The asr_provider key has the following properties:
#   "p_endpoint": "user_or_did@asr-server.com" %% The endpoint to bridge to
#   "p_account_id":"you@xmpp-server.com" %% the client's account id for receiving the text back
#   "p_account_pass":"secret" %% optional, password for the client's account
#   "p_lang":"us-EN" %% the language code for the ASR provider, defaults to "us-EN"
#
# So, the process becomes:
# 1) Prompt "Please say the name of the person you'd like to be connected to"
# 2) Send ASR request with CallID, ControlQ, and a response Q
# 3) Wait for ASR response with text of what was said
# 4) Find matches and iterate through the list, or go back to 1.
