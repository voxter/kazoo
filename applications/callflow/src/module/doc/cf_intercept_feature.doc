# Intercept a call in the specified device/user/extension
#
# data: {
#   "type" : "user | device | extension"
# }
#
# uses cf_capture_group and type to build parameters to branch to cf_intercept
#
# user -> lookup groups by number  (WIP)
# device -> lookup device by sip username
# extension -> lookup callflows
#
# usage example for BLF on spa504g
# the sip user of device we want to monitor for this example is 55578547
# on "Phone" Tab, go to "Line Key 2" and set
#   Extension : disabled
#   Share Call Appearance : private
#   Extended Function :fnc=blf+cp;sub=55578547@sip.domain.com;ext=55578547@sip.domain.com
#
# on "Attendant Console" Tab, set "Attendant Console Call Pickup Code:" to *98# instead of *98
# this way the username part of the subscription is passed along (*9855578547)
#
# create a "pattern callflow" with "patterns": ["^\\*98([0-9]*)$"]
# set the parameter "type" to "device"
#
#
# usage example for extension pickup
#
# 1) create a "pattern callflow" with "patterns": ["^\\*7([0-9]*)$"] and set the parameter "type" to "extension"
# 2) create simple callflow with number = 401 and set the target to a "ring group" or "page group"
# 3) dial 401 to start ringing the phones in group, in another phone dial *7401 to pickup the call
