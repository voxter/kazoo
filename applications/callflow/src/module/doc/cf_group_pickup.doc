# Pickup a call in the specified group

# data: {
#   "group_id":"_group_id_"
#   ,"user_id":"_user_id_"
#   ,"device_id":"_device_id_"
# }
#
# One of the three - group_id, user_id, or owner_id - must be defined on
# the data payload. Preference is given by most restrictive option set,
# so device_id is checked for first, then user_id, and finally group_id.
#
# device_id will only steal a channel currently ringing that device
# user_id will only steal a channel currently ringing any of the user's devices*
# group_id will steal a channel from any devices/users in a group*
#  * no guarantees on which if multiple inbound calls are ringing
